#mining play 

##mining play is server component of readmine (RSS Reader)
I also call it `readmine` service, and it is up and running at http://readmine.co

##Technology
scala / play framework/ mysql

##why yet another rss reader
mining play is designed to be **yet another** replacement for my favorite `Google Reader`. Over the years, I tried some replacements but none of them could be full replacement of `Google Reader`. 

key functions targeting this yet other reader
- `share favorite feed`: feeds among friends **(dev finish, test in progress)**
- `feed statistics` : reading habits, feed updates stats feed back **(dev in progress)**
- `reformatting article`: refromatting articles which are not easy to read **(in plan)**

##Reference
- Matt's GoRead. Thanks a lot to Matt for similar ideas to reader. but I really don't like go

##Issues
- directly log it at github
